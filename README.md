## Motivation

I am building some furniture and I need to make a lot of dowel joints. I wanted a way to do repeated joints with speed and precision.

## Parts Required

- 8x 608 bearings.
- 2x M2x6 for mounting clamp.

## Instructions

The design is parametric, but exported for 42mm wide timber.

1. Print out the parts.
2. Glue in the bearings using super-glue.
3. Attach the camp as required for alignment/positioning.
